## Base Image for fcgiwrap

fcgiwrap is a simple server for running CGI applications over FastCGI. Its goal is to provide clean CGI support to the nginx
webserver, although can be used with others.

fcgiwrap is lightweight and has no configuration, making it possible to use the same pool to run different sites.
